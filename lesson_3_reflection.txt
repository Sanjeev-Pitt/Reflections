When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I am working in colloboration with someone on some project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   It gives control when I want to do what.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork means copying someones repository directly to your personal git hub account. Clones means copying repository from git hub to your personal computer. Branches means dividing the main work into several sub parts.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

   In this way, it becomes easy to compare the changes made by the collaborators

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

   Through email, dropbox or google drive but it is very difficult to keep track of changes and everything becomes messy.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Changes in separate branches gives a benefit to get assured about the changes and may be get nod from colloborators.
